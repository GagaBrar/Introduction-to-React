# Controlled Componenents

Write a React program that displays users.

Your form to create your users should be at the top of your page and should include the following fields:

- Name

- Position (Select)
- A submit button.

Start with 3 default users in the system, displayed in a list.

When the form is submitted, create a new a new user and add it to the list.

Take a look at [Uncontrolled Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) and [Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html). Using uncontrolled components add some Javascript validation to ensure that all the name and email address of the forms are not empty.
