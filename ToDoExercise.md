# Your Todo List

Create your own To Do List!

## Requirements
- Your ToDo list should consist of 1 text input and 1 button.
- When a user fills in the input and clicks the button, the value in the input should create a new 'ToDo' on their list.
- Your app should show all of the users `incomplete` and `complete` ToDo's.
- Users can `delete` a ToDo, which will remove it from the list entirely or
- Users can `complete` a ToDo, which will mark it as `complete`.

For more fun 
- Add the various display capabilities to the todo list, such as `complete`, `incomplete` and `deleted`. 
- Add a date and timestamp to when users `completed` the ToDo
- Validate the input to make sure that there it contains a value before you create the new ToDo. If the value is empty, print an error message to the screen asking the user to fill in the value.
