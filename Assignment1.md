## Shopping Cart

### Items

- Your app should have a variety of items (at least 4) that a user can add to their shopping cart.

- Each item should have a price, a description, a name and an image.

- Each item should have a button or link that allows a user to add it to their shopping cart.

### Shopping Cart

- When users add items to the cart, the cart should display the amount of items in the cart.

- Only the cart and the *TOTAL* amount of items in it should be displayed on the main page.

- Your cart should be clickable. On clicking the cart, it will drive users to `/cart` page that will display all info and items related to your cart. You should use React Router to accomplish this.

- Your cart should display a subtotal that displays the total cost of all the items in your cart.

- Users should be able to remove items from the cart.

- If the cart has no items in it, the cart page should display a message that your cart is empty.
